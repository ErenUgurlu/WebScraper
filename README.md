# WebScraper

The purpose of this project is to scrape data from a website (this project I use etsy.com) when you enter a URL of a product  the app scrapes name, price, and image then 
saves data to the database and you can list the products on the database in the app


In this project I use ReactJs for the frontend and nodeJS for the backend development
